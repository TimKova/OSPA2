# PA#2 - Concurrent Hash Table
Felix Liu

This program implements a concurrent hash table with insert, delete, search, and print commands,
running each operation in a separate thread with proper locking and condition variable usage.

## AI Usage
Used ChatGPT to generate file structure, setup boilerplate for thread-safe hash table, and Jenkins hash function.

Prompts used:
- "Generate full file templates for a concurrent hash table with threads and locks in C."
- "Set up a Makefile to build a multi-file C project with pthreads."

All logic was reviewed and implemented with understanding of concurrency and synchronization.
